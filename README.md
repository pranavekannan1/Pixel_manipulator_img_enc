# Image Encryption & Decryption Tool
A beginner-friendly desktop app built with Python, Tkinter, and Pillow that lets you encrypt and decrypt images using simple pixel-based logic.

# Features
1.Choose any image (PNG, JPG)
2.Enter a secret key for encryption/decryption
3.Encrypts pixel values by modifying RGB components
4.Decrypts back using the same key
5.Save the encrypted or decrypted image to your device
6.Clean and simple user interface

# Requirements
-Python 3.x
-Pillow
-Tkinter (usually included with Python)

# How to Run
1.Clone or download this repo.
2.Run the script:
            1.Select an image
            2.Enter a numeric key
            3.Click Encrypt or Decrypt.
            4.Choose where to save the result

# How It Works
-Each image pixel is made of RGB values (Red, Green, Blue). This tool uses a numeric key to modify those values:
-Encryption: (R, G, B) + key % 256
-Decryption: (R, G, B) - key % 256

Itâ€™s a simple reversible transformation, just like a Caesar cipher for images!

# Example Use Case
Hide a confidential image before sharing it online.
Basic tool to teach cryptography and image encoding in classrooms.
Beginner Python GUI project for learning and showcasing.
